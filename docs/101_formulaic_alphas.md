Those seeking happiness, and bullfighters.”

Abstract
We present explicit formulas – that are also computer code – for
101 real-life quantitative trading alphas.  Their average holding
period approximately ranges 0.6-6.4 days.  The average pair-wise
correlation of these alphas is low, 15.9%.  The returns are strongly
correlated with volatility, but have no significant dependence on
turnover, directly confirming an earlier result based on a more
indirect empirical analysis.  We further find empirically that
turnover has poor explanatory power for alpha correlations.

1. Introduction
There are two complementary – and in some sense even competing – trends in modern
quantitative trading.  On the one hand, more and more market participants (e.g., quantitative
traders, inter alia) employ sophisticated quantitative techniques to mine alphas.4  This results in
ever fainter and more ephemeral alphas.  On the other hand, technological advances allow to
essentially automate (much of) the alpha harvesting process.  This yields an ever increasing
number of alphas, whose count can be in hundreds of thousands and even millions, and with
the exponentially increasing progress in this field will likely be in billions before we know it…
This proliferation of alphas – albeit mostly faint and ephemeral – allows combining them in
a sophisticated fashion to arrive at a unified “mega-alpha”.  It is then this “mega-alpha” that is
actually traded – as opposed to trading individual alphas – with a bonus of automatic internal
crossing of trades (and thereby crucial-for-profitability savings on trading costs, etc.), alpha
portfolio diversification (which hedges against any subset of alphas going bust in any given time
period), and so on.  One of the challenges in combining alphas is the usual “too many variables,
too few observations” dilemma.  Thus, the alpha sample covariance matrix is badly singular.
Also, naturally, quantitative trading is a secretive field and data and other information from
practitioners is not readily available.  This inadvertently creates an enigma around modern
quant trading.  E.g., with such a large number of alphas, are they not highly correlated with
each other?  What do these alphas look like?  Are they mostly based on price and volume data,
mean-reversion, momentum, etc.?  How do alpha returns depend on volatility, turnover, etc.?
In a previous paper [Kakushadze and Tulchinsky, 2015] took a step in demystifying the
realm of modern quantitative trading by studying some empirical properties of 4,000 real-life
alphas.  In this paper we take another step and present explicit formulas – that are also
computer code – for 101 real-life quant trading alphas.  Our formulaic alphas – albeit most are
not necessarily all that “simple” – serve a purpose of giving the reader a glimpse into what
some of the simpler real-life alphas look like.5  It also enables the reader to replicate and test
these alphas on historical data and do new research and other empirical analyses.  Hopefully, it
further inspires (young) researchers to come up with new ideas and create their own alphas.

4 “An alpha is a combination of mathematical expressions, computer source code, and configuration parameters
that can be used, in combination with historical data, to make predictions about future movements of various
financial instruments.” [Tulchinsky et al, 2015]  Here “alpha” – following the common trader lingo – generally
means any reasonable “expected return” that one may wish to trade on and is not necessarily the same as the
“academic” alpha.  In practice, often the detailed information about how alphas are constructed may even not be
available, e.g., the only data available could be the position data, so “alpha” then is a set of instructions to achieve
certain stock (or other instrument) holdings by some times $t_1$, $t_2$, ... (e.g., a tickers by holdings matrix for each $t$).

5 We picked these alphas largely based on simplicity considerations, so they can be presented within the inherent
limitations of a paper.  There also exist myriad other, “non-formulaic” (coded and too-complex-to-present) alphas.

We discuss some general features of our formulaic alphas in Section 2.  These alphas are
mostly “price-volume” (daily close-to-close returns, open, close, high, low, volume and vwap)
based, albeit “fundamental” input is used in some of the alphas, including one alpha utilizing
market cap, and a number of alphas employing some kind of a binary industry classification
such as GICS, BICS, NAICS, SIC, etc., which are used to industry-neutralize various quantities.6
We discuss empirical properties of our alphas in Section 3 based on data for individual alpha
Sharpe ratio, turnover and cents-per-share, and also on a sample covariance matrix.  The
average holding period approximately ranges from 0.6 to 6.4 days.  The average (median) pair-
wise correlation of these alphas is low, 15.9% (14.3%).  The returns R_i are strongly correlated
with the volatility \sigma_i, and as in [Kakushadze and Tulchinsky, 2015] we find an empirical scaling
$$
R_i \sim \sigma_i^\eta
$$                                                                          (1)
with \eta ≈0.76 for our 101 alphas.  Furthermore, we find that the returns have no significant
dependence on the turnover T_i.  This is a direct confirmation of an earlier result by [Kakushadze
and Tulchinsky, 2015], which is based on a more indirect empirical analysis.7
We further find empirically that the turnover per se has poor explanatory power for alpha
correlations.  This is not to say that the turnover does not add value in, e.g., modeling the
covariance matrix via a factor model.8  A more precise statement is that pair-wise correlations $\Psi_{ij}$ of the alphas ($i, j = 1, \dots, N$, $i \neq j$) are not highly correlated with the product $\ln(\tau_i)\ln(\tau_j)$, where $\tau_i = T_i / T_*$ and $T_*$ is an a priori arbitrary normalization constant.9
We briefly conclude in Section 4.  Appendix A contains our formulaic alphas with definitions
of the functions, operators and input data used therein.  Appendix B contains some legalese.
2. Formulaic Alphas
In this section we describe some general features of our 101 formulaic alphas.  The alphas
are proprietary to WorldQuant LLC and are used here with its express permission.  We provide
as many details as we possibly can within the constraints imposed by the proprietary nature of
the alphas.  The formulaic expressions – that are also computer code – are given in Appendix A.

6 More precisely, depending on the alpha and industry classification used, neutralization can be w.r.t. sectors,
industries, subindustries, etc. – different classifications use different nomenclature for levels of similar granularity.

7 In [Kakushadze and Tulchinsky, 2015] the alpha return volatility was not directly available and was estimated
indirectly based on the Sharpe ratio, cents-per-share and turnover data.  Here we use direct realized volatility data.

8 Depending on a construction, a priori the turnover might add value via the specific (idiosyncratic) risk for alphas.

9 Here we use log of the turnover as opposed to the turnover itself as the latter has a skewed, roughly log-normal
distribution, while pair-wise correlations take values in (−1, 1) (in fact, their distribution is tighter – see below).

Very coarsely, one can think of alpha signals as based on mean-reversion or momentum.10
A mean-reversion alpha has a sign opposite to the return on which it is based.  E.g., a simple
mean-reversion alpha is given by
−ln(today's open / yesterday's close)                                              (2)
Here yesterday’s close is adjusted for any splits and dividends if the ex-date is today.  The idea
(or hope) here is that the stock will mean-revert and give back part of the gains (if today’s open
is higher than yesterday’s close) or recoup part of the losses (if today’s open is lower than
yesterday’s close).  This is a so-called “delay-0” alpha.  Generally, “delay-0” means that the time
of some data (e.g., a price) used in the alpha coincides with the time during which the alpha is
intended to be traded.  E.g., the alpha (2) would ideally be traded at or, more realistically, as
close as possible to today’s open.  More broadly, this can be some other time, e.g., the close.11
A simple example of a momentum alpha is given by
ln(yesterday′s close / yesterday's open)                                            (3)
Here it makes no difference if the prices are adjusted or not.  The idea (or hope) here is that if
the stock ran up (slid down) yesterday, the trend will continue today and the gains (losses) will
be further increased.  This is a so-called “delay-1” alpha if the intent is to trade it today (e.g.,
starting at the open).12  Generally, “delay-1” means that the alpha is traded on the day
subsequent to the date of the most recent data used in computing it.  A “delay-2” alpha is
defined similarly, with 2 counting the number of days by which the data used is out-of-sample.
In complex alphas elements of mean-reversion and momentum can be mixed, making them
less distinct in this regard.  However, one can think of smaller building blocks of such alphas as
being based on mean-reversion or momentum.  For instance, Alpha#101 in Appendix A is a
delay-1 momentum alpha: if the stock runs up intraday (i.e., close > open and high > low), the
next day one takes a long position in the stock.  On the other hand, Alpha#42 in Appendix A
essentially is a delay-0 mean-reversion alpha: rank(vwap – close) is lower if a stock runs up in
the second half of the day (close > vwap)13 as opposed to sliding down (close < vwap).  The
denominator weights down richer stocks.  The “contrarian” position is taken close to the close.

10 On longer horizons, for a discussion of mean-reversion (contrarian) and momentum (trend following) strategies,
see, e.g., [Avellanida and Lee, 2010] and [Jegadeesh and Titman, 1993], respectively, and references therein.

11 Four of our 101 alphas in Appendix A, namely, the alphas numbered 42, 48, 53 and 54, are delay-0 alphas.  They
are assumed to be traded at or as close as possible to the close of the trading day for which they are computed.

12 On the other hand, if the alpha (3) is executed as close as possible to yesterday’s close, then it is delay-0.

13 Here “vwap”, as usual, stands for “volume-weighted average price”.

3. Data and Empirical Properties of Alphas
In this section we describe empirical properties of our formulaic alphas based on data
proprietary to WorldQuant LLC, which is used here with its express permission.  We provide as
many details as possible within the constraints of the proprietary nature of this dataset.
For our alphas we take the annualized daily Sharpe ratio 3, daily turnover T_i, and cents-per-
share 4.  Let us label our alphas by the index i (i = 1, … , ), where  = 101 is the number of
alphas.  For each alpha, 3i, T_ii and 4i are defined via
3i = √252 7i
\sigma_ii
(4)
$$
T_ii = 9i
$$
:i
(5)
4i = 100 7i
;i
(6)
Here: 7i is the average daily P&L (in dollars); \sigma_ii is the daily portfolio volatility; ;i is the average
daily shares traded (buys plus sells) by the i-th alpha; 9i is the average daily dollar volume
traded; and :i is the total dollar investment in said alpha (the actual long plus short positions,
without leverage).  More precisely, the principal of :i is constant; however, :i fluctuates due to
the daily P&L.  So, both 9i and :i are adjusted accordingly (such that :i is constant) in Equation
(4).  The period of time over which this data is collected is Jan 4, 2010-Dec 31, 2013.  For the
same period we also take the sample covariance matrix <ij of the realized daily returns for our
alphas.  The number of observations in the time series is 1,006, and <ij is nonsingular.  From <ij
we read off the daily return volatility =i
$$
= <ii and the correlation matrix  \Psi_{ij}ij = <ij / =i =j
$$
(where \Psi_{ij}ii = 1).  Note that \sigma_ii = =i :i, and the average14 daily return is given by R_ii = 7i / :i.
Table 1 and Figure 1 summarize the data for the annualized Sharpe ratio 3i, daily turnover,
$$
T_ii, average holding period 1 / T_ii, cents-per-share 4i, daily return volatility =i, annualized
average daily return R_i>i = 252 R_ii, and ( −1)/2 pair-wise correlations \Psi_{ij}ij with i > j.
$$
3.1. Return v. Volatility & Turnover
$$
We run two cross-sectional regressions, both with the intercept, of ln(R_ii) over i) ln(=i) as
$$
the sole explanatory variable, and ii) over ln(=i) and ln(T_ii).  The results are summarized in
Tables 2 and 3.  Consistently with [Kakushadze and Tulchinsky, 2015], we have no statistically

14  Here the average is over the time series of the realized daily returns.

significant dependence on the turnover T_ii here, while the average daily return R_ii is strongly
$$
correlated with the daily return volatility =i and we have the scaling property (1) with \eta ≈0.76.
$$
3.2. Does Turnover Explain Correlations?
If we draw a parallel between alphas and stocks, then alpha turnover is analogous to stock
liquidity, which is typically measured via an average daily dollar volume (ADDV).15  Log of ADDV
is routinely used as a style risk factor16 in multifactor risk models17 for approximating stock
portfolio covariance matrix structure, whose chief goal is to model the off-diagonal elements of
the covariance matrix, that is, the pair-wise correlation structure.18  Following this analogy, we
can ask if the turnover – or more precisely its log – has explanatory power for modeling alpha
correlations.19  It is evident that using the turnover directly (as opposed to its log) would get us
nowhere due to the highly skewed (roughly log-normal) turnover distribution (see Figure 1).
To answer this question, recall that in a factor model the covariance matrix is modeled via
@ij = Ai
Bij + D EiF
G
F,HI
JFH EjH                                              (7)
Here: Ai
is the specific risk; EiF is an  × L factor loadings matrix corresponding to L ≪ risk
factors; and JFH is a factor covariance matrix.  In our case, we are interested in modeling the
correlation matrix \Psi_{ij}ij and ascertaining whether the turnover has explanatory power for pair-
wise correlations.  Whether the volatility and turnover are correlated is a separate issue.
So, our approach is to take one of the columns of the factor loadings matrix as ln(T_ii).  More
precisely, a priori there is no reason why we should pick ln(T_ii) as opposed to ln( i), where
i = T_ii / ", and " is some normalization factor.  To deal with this, let us normalize  i such that
ln( i) has zero cross-sectional mean, and let Ni = 1 be the unit -vector (the intercept).  Then
$$
we can construct three symmetric tensor combinations Oij = Ni Nj, Pij = Ni lnQ jR + Nj ln( i),
$$
and Sij = ln( i) lnQ jR.  Let us now define a composite index TUV = T(i, j)|i > jV, which takes
$$
X =  ( −1)/2 values, i.e., we pull the off-diagonal lower-triangular elements of a general

$$
15 Perhaps a more precise analogy would be between the turnover and the ratio of ADDV and market cap;
however, this is not going to be critical for our purposes here.

16 For liquidity as a style risk factor, see, e.g., [Pastor and Stambaugh, 2003] and references therein.

17 See, e.g., [Grinold and Kahn, 2000] and references therein.

18 Variances are relatively stable and can be computed based on historical data (sample variances).  It is the off-
diagonal elements of the sample covariance matrix – to wit, the correlations – that are out-of-sample unstable.

19 Log of the turnover as a factor for risk models for alpha portfolios was suggested in [Kakushadze, 2014].

symmetric matrix Yij into a vector YZ.  This way we can construct four X-vectors \Psi_{ij}Z, OZ, PZ and
SZ.  Now we can run a linear regression of \Psi_{ij}Z over OZ, PZ and SZ.  Note that OZ =  1 is simply
the intercept (the unit X-vector), so this is a regression of \Psi_{ij}Z over PZ and SZ with the intercept.
The results are summarized in Table 4.  It is evident that the linear and bilinear (in ln( i))
variables  PZ and SZ have poor explanatory power for pair-wise correlations \Psi_{ij}Z, while OZ (the
intercept) simply models the average correlation Mean(\Psi_{ij}Z).  Recall that by construction PZ and
SZ are orthogonal to OZ, and these three explanatory variables are independent of each other.
Let us emphasize that our conclusion does not necessarily mean the turnover adds no value
in the factor model context, it only means that the turnover per se does not appear to help in
modeling pair-wise alpha correlations.  The above analysis does not address whether the
turnover adds explanatory value to modeling variances, e.g., the specific risk.20  Thus, a linear
regression of ln(=) over ln(T_i) (with the intercept) shows nonzero correlation between these
variables (see Table 5), albeit not very strong.  To see if the turnover adds value via, e.g., the
specific risk requires using certain proprietary methods outside of the scope of this paper.21
4. Conclusions
We emphasize that the 101 alphas we present here are not “toy” alphas but real-life trading
alphas used in production.  In fact, 80 of these alphas are in production as of this writing.22  To
our knowledge, this is the first time such a large number of real-life explicit formulaic alphas
appear in the literature.  This should come as no surprise: naturally, quant trading is highly
proprietary and secretive.  Our goal here is to provide a glimpse into the complex world of
modern and ever-evolving quantitative trading and help demystify it, to any degree possible.
Technological advances nowadays allow automation of alpha mining.  Quantitative trading
alphas are by far the most numerous of available trading signals that can be turned into trading
strategies/portfolios.  There are myriad permutations of individual stock holdings in a (dollar-
neutral) portfolio of, e.g., 2,000 most liquid U.S. stocks that can result in a positive return on
high- and mid-frequency time horizons.  In addition, many of these alphas are ephemeral and
their universe is very fluid.  It takes quantitatively sophisticated, technologically well-endowed
and ever-adapting trading operations to mine hundreds of thousands, millions and even billions
of alphas and combine them into a unified “mega-alpha”, which is then traded with an added
bonus of sizeable savings on execution costs due to automatic internal crossing of trades.

20 Suppressing alpha weights by the turnover can add value but be highly correlated with volatility suppression.

21 Roughly speaking, when the specific risk is computed via nontrivial (proprietary) methods, the column in the
factor loadings matrix corresponding to the turnover is no longer proportional to ln( i) but is a more complex
function of the turnover, the specific risk also depends on the turnover nontrivially and is not quadratic in ln( i).

22 For proprietary reasons, we are not at liberty to state precisely which ones.

In this spirit, we end this paper with an 1832 poem by a Russian poet Mikhail Lermontov
(translation from Russian by Zura Kakushadze, ca. 1993):

The Sail

A lonely sail seeming white,

In misty haze mid blue sea,

Be foreign gale seeking might?

Why home bays did it flee?

The sail’s bending mast is creaking,

The wind and waves blast ahead,

It isn’t happiness it’s seeking,

Nor is it happiness it’s fled!

Beneath are running ázure streams,

Above are shining golden beams,

But wishing storms the sail seems,

As if in storms is peace it deems.

A.1. Functions and Operators
(Below “{ }” stands for a placeholder.  All expressions are case insensitive.)
$$
abs(x), log(x), sign(x) = standard definitions; same for the operators “+”, “-”, “*”, “/”, “>”, “<”,
$$
“==”, “||”, “x ? y : z”
rank(x) = cross-sectional rank
$$
delay(x, d) = value of x d days ago
correlation(x, y, d) = time-serial correlation of x and y for the past d days
covariance(x, y, d) = time-serial covariance of x and y for the past d days
scale(x, a) = rescaled x such that sum(abs(x)) = a (the default is a = 1)
delta(x, d) = today’s value of x minus the value of x d days ago
signedpower(x, a) = x^a
$$
decay_linear(x, d) = weighted moving average over the past d days with linearly decaying
weights d, d – 1, …, 1 (rescaled to sum up to 1)
indneutralize(x, g) = x cross-sectionally neutralized against groups g (subindustries, industries,
sectors, etc.), i.e., x is cross-sectionally demeaned within each group g
$$
ts_{O}(x, d) = operator O applied across the time-series for the past d days; non-integer number
$$
of days d is converted to floor(d)
$$
ts_min(x, d) = time-series min over the past d days
$$

## Page 16

16

$$
ts_max(x, d) = time-series max over the past d days
ts_argmax(x, d) = which day ts_max(x, d) occurred on
ts_argmin(x, d) = which day ts_min(x, d) occurred on
ts_rank(x, d) = time-series rank in the past d days
min(x, d) = ts_min(x, d)
max(x, d) = ts_max(x, d)
sum(x, d) = time-series sum over the past d days
$$
product(x, d) = time-series product over the past d days
stddev(x, d) = moving time-series standard deviation over the past d days
A.2. Input Data
returns = daily close-to-close returns
open, close, high, low, volume = standard definitions for daily price and volume data
vwap = daily volume-weighted average price
cap = market cap
adv{d} = average daily dollar volume for the past d days
IndClass = a generic placeholder for a binary industry classification such as GICS, BICS, NAICS,
SIC, etc., in indneutralize(x, IndClass.level), where level = sector, industry, subindustry, etc.
Multiple IndClass in the same alpha need not correspond to the same industry classification.
